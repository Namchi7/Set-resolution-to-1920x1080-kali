# Set-resolution-to-1920x1080-kali

Kali by default does not (atleat in my case) give us the option to set our screen resolution to 1920x1080. So this simple three line script does it for us.

To run the the script, type the below given command in your terminal:
bash setscreen.sh

If it does no run try:
sudo bash setscreen.sh
